## How to Use

1. Open any notebook from the `notebooks/` folder in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
2. Make sure required Python libraries are installed:
   ```
   pip install matplotlib seaborn pandas numpy plotly librosa PIL folium
   ```
3. Run all cells to visualize outputs.

## Notes

- All notebooks here are verified and updated.
- Duplicates or incomplete files from earlier versions have been excluded.

## 🌐 Note on Interactive Maps

Some notebooks use interactive visualizations (e.g., Choropleth maps with Plotly or Folium).  
📌 These work best in **Google Colab** or a **local Jupyter environment** — JupyterLab or VSCode preferred.  
To open in Colab, upload the notebook and select **Open with Colab**.
